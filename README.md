# Infinity
∞ Become one with the Infinity ∞

In this website you can endlessly scroll down and explore infinitely generated constellations consisting of white circles of different sizes. 
When you hover the mouse or click on any of the circles, its color changes to completely random. 
If you need to go back to the top of the page, click the green arrow located on the bottom right.

This website was made just for fun, so the project does not pretend to be anything serious or profesionally made.
